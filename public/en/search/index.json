The ability to use a computer depends on your attitude towards the computer. You need to think of the computer as a toy, not a tool, and you need to think of the system and software as a game. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t go to dangerous areas such as fiddling with system settings, you generally won\u0026rsquo;t break your computer. So: be brave! Be brave to try and gain experience. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of this or that. If you hold back, you will never see the other side of victory.\nSecond, check If you have any questions, go to Bing and search for it. Don\u0026rsquo;t use Baidu anymore, it\u0026rsquo;s all advertisements and useless shoddy information.

If you have learned the basic operation of the computer (such as switching on and off, clicking the mouse and keyboard...) the next step, you should learn the principles of computer use.
# General
## One, brave
Some people say that I was born with computer skills, but this is not true. The ability to use a computer depends on your attitude towards the computer. You need to think of the computer as a toy, not a tool, and you need to think of the system and software as a game. As long as you don't go to dangerous areas such as fiddling with system settings, you generally won't break your computer. So: be brave! Be brave to try and gain experience. Don't be afraid of this or that. If you hold back, you will never see the other side of victory.
## Second, check
If you have any questions, go to [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) and search for it. Don't use Baidu anymore, it's all advertisements and useless shoddy information. Remember, check before asking.
## Three, note
When you learn a skill, remember it.
## Four, practice
Practice more, try more, summarize more
## Five, realize
Never expect the most detailed tutorial, you need to comprehend and explore the unknown world by yourself.

1. Put the file on the desktop
2. Install the software to the C drive

# install software
The first problem that plagues many computer beginners is installing software.
Open [pc.qq.com](pc.qq.com), search for the software name in the search bar on the upper right, and then find the software you want in the results, click the <span style="color:red" on the green button on the right ">Small arrow</span> and click <span style="color:red">Normal Download</span>. Open the downloaded installation package, 95% of the software can customize the installation location during installation. Create a new folder on the D drive and name it the same as the software name (in English, capitalized). If the software name is in Chinese, please spell it in pinyin with capitalized first letter, without spaces (such as Baofengyingyin: Baofeng), do not add any Punctuation. Select the directory to install. Pay attention to detail options when installing.
